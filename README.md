## About
This project is a partial recreation of CivicQA, an open source constituent management platform.

This project re-implements core features including the creation and manangement of forms, responses, and tags. Notably missing are the visualzation and organizational features. The main purpose of this re-implementation was for me to explore ASP.NET Core MVC development with a semi real-world project. 

## Design
This project uses an MVC architecture with views for the following features/models:
- Forms
- Responses
- Tags
- Search
- Inbox Management
- Account Management
